A module for modeling a P2P network into a graph and testing violation and optimization of a graph.   

* `samples/g_8_100_99_1.csv` demonstrates a problem because MAX = 50 and n = 100 
meaning the graph is violating because the dns has more than 50 in.
=> dns architechture.
 
* adding a fix to the script is needed because according to above, even 10 dns dont solve 
since they currently connect to all the dns's. 
need to seperate connections so the graph will be valid.
